üö® CRITICAL SCHEDULING RULES:
- **NEVER change Fixed Task times** - they are locked in place
- **NEVER move or reorder Fixed Tasks** - keep their exact times
- **Work around Fixed Tasks** - schedule flexible tasks in remaining slots
- **Prioritize missed tasks first** when filling available time
- **Respect priority levels**: High > Medium > Low
- **Generate two varied schedule options** by shuffling flexible task order
- **EVERY task MUST have different start and end times** (e.g., 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM, NOT 9:00 AM to 9:00 AM)
- NO overlapping time slots - each task gets its own unique time period
- **Use the estimated time** provided for each task to calculate proper end times
- **Schedule tasks sequentially** - don't put multiple tasks at the same time
- If there‚Äôs not enough time for a task today, push it to tomorrow
- Do not add any tasks by yourself only make schedule based on the tasks that are given

ÔøΩ FIXED TASKS (DO NOT CHANGE THESE TIMES):
${fixed || 'None'}

ÔøΩ FLEXIBLE TASKS (Schedule around fixed tasks):
${flex || 'None'}

‚ö†Ô∏è MISSED TASKS (Prioritize rescheduling):
${missed || 'None'}

üì§ REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (strictly follow):

Schedule Option 1:
- Task Name - Start Time to End Time
- Task Name - Start Time to End Time

Schedule Option 2:
- Task Name - Start Time to End Time
- Task Name - Start Time to End Time

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT FORMATTING:
- Daily DSA - 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM
- Reading - 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM
- Workout - 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM

EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT FORMATTING (DO NOT DO THIS):
- Reading - 10:00 AM to 10:00 AM ‚ùå (same start/end time)
- Workout - 10:00 AM to 10:00 AM ‚ùå (overlapping with reading)

Rescheduled Missed Tasks:
- Task Name
